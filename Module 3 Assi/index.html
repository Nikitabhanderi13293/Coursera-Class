			     Vada pav, alternatively spelt vada pao, wada pav, or wada pao, is a vegetarian fast food dish native to the state of Maharashtra. The dish consists of a deep fried potato dumpling placed inside a bread bun (pav) sliced almost in half through the middle. It is generally accompanied with one or more chutneys and a green chilli pepper. Although it originated as cheap street food in Mumbai, it is now served in food stalls and restaurants across India. It is also called Bombay burger in keeping with its origins and its resemblance in physical form to a burger.The most common theory of the vada pav's origin is that it was invented in the erstwhile mill-heartland of Central Mumbai. The carbohydrate-rich snack catered to the mill workers of what was then known as Girangaon. The combination of the potato dumpling (batata vada) placed inside a pav quickly became popular in Girangaon and later the rest of Maharashtra. The favourite snacks in Maharashtra, vada pav is claimed to be a part of the culture of Marathis.One of the earliest kiosks selling vada pav is said to be Khidki Vada Pav located in Kalyan.[citation needed] It was started in the late 1960s by the Vaze family, who used to hand out vada pav from a window of their house facing the road.Variant of vada pav is Pav vada famous in Nashik as street food. Pav vada is tempered mashed potato is filled in pav and dipped into gram flour batter and deep fried, eaten with chutney and chilly.

			     A dosa is a cooked flat thin layered rice batter, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosas are a typical part of the Southern Indian and Sri Lankan Tamil diets, but the dish is now popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with sambar and chutney. They can be consumed with idli podi as well.Dosas originated in South India; their exact birthplace in that region is a matter of conjecture.[1] According to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the Udupi town of present-day Karnataka. According to food historian K. T. Achaya, dosa (as dosai) was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century AD, as per references in the Sangam literature. In popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with the Udupi restaurants. Also, the original Tamil dosa was softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka. A recipe for dosa (as dosaka) can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka. After the Independence of India, South Indian cuisine became gradually popular in the North. In Delhi the Madras Hotel in Connaught Place became a landmark that was one of the first restaurants to serve South Indian cuisine. It arrived in Mumbai with the Udupi restaurants in the 1930s.

			     The history of pizza begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with several toppings. A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flat bread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings were then added. Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. The word pizza was first documented in A.D. 997 in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.In the 6th century BC, Persian soldiers serving under Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields. In Ancient Greece, citizens made a flat bread called plakous which was flavored with toppings like herbs, onion, cheese and garlic. An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid (ca. 19 BC), when Celaeno, the Harpy queen, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno.
